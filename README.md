# opencv_tennisball_tracking
OpenCV is a powerful opensource library in Python used for many computer vision projects.  
This project was used to recognize tennis balls for my autonomous robot.  In the future, I would like to scale
this project to transition states for my autonomous robot.  The goal will be for the robot to pick up tennis
balls to empty the court.
